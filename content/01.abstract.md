## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The abstract will be written at the end, here are some key points

- Python
- Only free and open-source software
- Image analysis
- Fully reproducible research
- Efficiently done, already during scan of parts of the batch.
  New scans are just dumped on the script to process.
- Probably not possible manually in the needed time-frame or extremely cumbersome (huge batch-process).
- Everyone can do/check it, show it in Binder!
