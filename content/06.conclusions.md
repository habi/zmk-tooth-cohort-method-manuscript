## Conclusions {.page_break_before}
The presented method offers an efficient approach to scan, check and preview micro-computer tomographic datasets of many teeth.
We describe a helpful, free and open-source software tool to prepare datasets for precise description and characterization of the internal morphology of human permanent teeth using automated segmentation of features of interest.
Due to the high reproducibility and standardization of the presented method, datasets of large cohorts and populations can be investigated easily and rapidly.

A follow-up study will fully describe the cohort mentioned in this manuscript and use the hereby presented method for describing the teeth in detail.
