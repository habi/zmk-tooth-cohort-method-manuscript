## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Successful endodontic treatments require a precise knowledge of the external and internal morphology of the teeth [@doi:10/c9wr8n].
For both surgical and non-surgical interventions it is necessary to know both the complex three-dimensional root canal system with its configurations as well as the details of the apical region of the tooth.
This knowledge is necessary to select the correct instruments and materials, thus aiding in important treatment decisions.
It also helps to avoid errors that can occur during various steps of clinical endodontic treatment, such as preparation of the access cavity, rinsing, shaping and filling of the root canal system [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2006.02.007].
For example, these errors can include perforations during trepanation or failure in preparing the root canals.
A detailed description and understanding of the root canal system is, therefore, essential for the clinical practitioner.
At present, there are numerous imaging methods for the morphological description of teeth presented in the literature, including the clearing technique [@doi:10.4103/2278-9626.126215], optical microscopy [@doi:10.4067/s0717-95022014000200048], two-dimensional radiography, scanning electron microscopy, or three-dimensional imaging techniques such as cone beam computer tomography and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.002].

Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a method to non-destructively image the internals of objects of interest, namely biomedical samples at high resolution, i.e. in the micrometer range.
Micro-CT imaging is well suited for the three-dimensional (3D) investigation of teeth since it needs no specialized sample preparation in contrast to what is often needed to image soft tissue samples [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12013; @doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1109/tbme.2014.2317554].
Combined with software rendering, it is a non-destructive, high-resolution, 3D imaging technique that can precisely depict small morphological structures (\< 20 Âµm) in teeth thus making it superior to other *ex-vivo* methods and therefore, suggested as a gold standard in the field [@doi:10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0091; @doi:10.1111/iej.12593; @doi:10.1046/j.1365-2591.1999.00204.x].
Micro-CT is increasingly used for investigation of epidemiological questions to provide the dentist with necessary information that is a prerequisite for successful endodontic treatment [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2019.11.006; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2020.08.012; @doi:10.1007/s00784-020-03284-7].

Clinically relevant for the dentist are both the root canal configuration and the physiological procedure.
Both parameters are important, as they give information about the expected anatomical conditions and the size of the physiological foramen for clinical purposes.
Due to the batch-scanning capabilities of recent desktop micro-CT systems large cohorts of teeth can be efficiently scanned with minimal manual intervention, generating terabytes of raw data for further analysis.
Such a large amount of data necessitates an efficient, reproducible and automated framework to analyze such large tomographic datasets.
Previous works have already analyzed large batches of teeth, but only for a small region of each tooth [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2018.10.019; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2009.04.020] and with a considerable degree of manual input required for tooth segmentation [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2019.11.006; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2015.09.007].
The hereby presented protocol provides an automated segmentation method for *ex vivo* research on extracted human teeth using a four-digit root canal configuration code as well as detection and measurement of the physiological foramen parameters.
We achieved this by using free and open-source software [@isbn:978-0262062466], considerably increasing the impact and availability of our method for collaborators and other users in the field.
