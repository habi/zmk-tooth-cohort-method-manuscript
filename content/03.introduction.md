## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Successful endodontic treatments require a precise knowledge of the external and internal morphology of the teeth [@doi:10.1016/0030-4220\(84\)90085-9].
For both surgical and non-surgical interventions it is necessary to know both the complex three-dimensional root canal system with its configurations as well as the details of the apical region of the tooth.
This knowledge is necessary to select the correct instruments and materials and thus make important treatment decisions.
It also helps to avoid errors that can occur during various steps of clinical endodontic treatment, such as preparation of the access cavity, rinsing, shaping and filling of the root canal system [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2006.02.007].
The errors include, for example, frequently occurring perforations during trepanation or failure in preparing the root canals.
A detailed description and understanding of the root canal system are essential for the clinical practitioner.
Nowadays, in the literature there are numerous imaging methods for the morphological description of teeth, such as clearing technique [@doi:10.4103/2278-9626.126215], optical microscopy [@doi:10.4067/s0717-95022014000200048], two-dimensional radiography, scanning electron microscopy, or three-dimensional imaging techniques such as cone beam computer tomography and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.002].

Micro-CT imaging is a method to non-destructively study objects of interest, namely biomedical samples at high resolution, i.e. in the micrometer range.
Micro-CT imaging is well suited for the three-dimensional (3D) investigation of teeth since it needs no specialized sample preparation in contrast to what is often needed to image soft tissue samples [@doi:10.1111/jmi.12013; @doi:10.1016/j.vph.2018.09.003; @doi:10.1109/tbme.2014.2317554].
Combined with software rendering it is a non-destructive, high-resolution, 3D imaging technique that is able to precisely depict small morphological structures (\<20 Âµm) in teeth and thus provides information that is superior to other methods in *ex vivo* research and has therefore been suggested as a gold standard [@doi:10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0091; @doi:10.1111/iej.12593; @doi:10.1046/j.1365-2591.1999.00204.x].
Micro-CT is increasingly used for investigation of epidemiological questions to provide the dentist with necessary information that is a prerequisite for successful endodontic treatment [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2019.11.006.; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2020.08.012; @doi:10.1007/s00784-020-03284-7].

Clinically relevant for the dentist are, on the one hand, the root canal configuration and, on the other hand, the physiological procedure.
Both parameters are important, as they give information about the expected anatomical conditions and the size of the physiological foramen for clinical purposes.
Due to the relatively low cost and batch-scanning capabilities of recent desktop micro-CT systems large cohorts of teeth can be scanned in a relatively short time, generating terabytes of raw data.
Such a large amount of data necessitates an efficient, reproducible and automated framework to analyze such large batches of tomographic datasets.
Previous works have already analyzed large batches of teeth, but only for a small region of each tooth [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2018.10.019; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2009.04.020], with considerable manual work for the segmentation of the tooth [@doi:/10.1016/j.joen.2019.11.006; @doi:10.1016/j.joen.2015.09.007].
The hereby presented protocol provides an automated segmentation method for *ex vivo* research on extracted human teeth using a four-digit root canal configuration code as well as detection and measurement of the physiological foramen parameters.
We achieve this by using free and open-source software [@isbn:978-0262062466], the fact which we believe to considerably increase the potential impact of our work, e.g. making it widely available for collaborators and other users.
