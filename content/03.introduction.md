## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Successful endodontic treatments require a precise knowledge of the external and internal morphology of the teeth [@doi:10.1016/0030-4220(84)90085-9].
For both surgical and non-surgical interventions it is necessary to know both the complex three-dimensional root canal system with its configurations as well as the details of the apical region of the tooth.
This knowledge is necessary to select the correct instruments and materials and thus make important treatment decisions.
It also helps to avoid errors that can occur during various steps of clinical endodontic treatment, such as preparation of the access cavity, rinsing, shaping and filling of the root canal system [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2006.02.007].
The errors include, for example, frequently occurring perforations during trepanation or failure in preparing the root canals.
A detailed description and understanding of the root canal system are essential for the clinical practitioner.
Nowadays, in the literature there are numerous imaging methods for the morphological description of teeth, such as clearing technique [@doi:10.4103/2278-9626.126215], optical microscopy [@doi:10.4067/s0717-95022014000200048], two-dimensional radiography, scanning electron microscopy, or three-dimensional imaging techniques such as cone beam computer tomography and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) [@doi:10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.002].
